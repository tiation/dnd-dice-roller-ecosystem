# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide - Step by Step

## 🎯 **Current Status**
You're at the Vercel login screen. Here's what to do next:

### Step 1: Login to Vercel
```bash
# The CLI is currently asking you to choose:
❯ Continue with GitHub  ← Select this (recommended)
  Continue with Google
  Continue with Email
```

**Choose "Continue with GitHub"** - this will:
1. Open your browser
2. Ask you to authorize Vercel
3. Link your GitHub account automatically

### Step 2: After Login - Deploy
Once logged in, run:
```bash
vercel
```

You'll see prompts like this:
```bash
? Set up and deploy "dnd-character-sheets-saas"? [Y/n] ← Type: y
? Which scope do you want to deploy to? ← Select your account
? Link to existing project? [y/N] ← Type: n
? What's your project's name? dnd-character-sheets-saas ← Press Enter (default)
? In which directory is your code located? ./ ← Press Enter (default)
```

### Step 3: Vercel Will Auto-Detect
```bash
Auto-detected Project Settings (Next.js):
- Build Command: npm run build
- Output Directory: .next
- Install Command: npm install
- Development Command: npm run dev
? Want to modify these settings? [y/N] ← Type: n
```

### Step 4: Deployment Process
You'll see:
```bash
🔗 Linked to your-username/dnd-character-sheets-saas
🔍 Inspect: https://vercel.com/your-username/dnd-character-sheets-saas/xyz
✅ Production: https://dnd-character-sheets-saas-xyz.vercel.app [copied to clipboard]
```

## 🔧 **After Deployment - Environment Variables**

Your app will deploy but might have database issues. You need to add environment variables:

### Method 1: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easier)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your project: `dnd-character-sheets-saas`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables:

```bash
# Required Variables
DATABASE_URL = file:./dev.db
NEXTAUTH_SECRET = your-random-32-character-secret-here
NEXTAUTH_URL = https://your-app.vercel.app
```

### Method 2: Via CLI
```bash
# Add environment variables via CLI
vercel env add DATABASE_URL
# When prompted, enter: file:./dev.db
# Select: Production and Preview

vercel env add NEXTAUTH_SECRET  
# When prompted, enter a random 32+ character string
# Select: Production and Preview

vercel env add NEXTAUTH_URL
# When prompted, enter your app URL from step 4
# Select: Production and Preview
```

### Step 5: Redeploy with Environment Variables
```bash
vercel --prod
```

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### If Database Issues:
The SQLite database might not work perfectly on Vercel. For production, consider:

1. **Upgrade to PostgreSQL** (recommended):
```bash
# Sign up for free PostgreSQL at:
# - Supabase: https://supabase.com (free tier)
# - PlanetScale: https://planetscale.com (free tier)
# - Neon: https://neon.tech (free tier)

# Then update DATABASE_URL to the provided connection string
```

2. **Or use Vercel KV** (for simple storage):
```bash
# Add Vercel KV addon in your dashboard
# Perfect for simple character storage
```

### If Build Fails:
```bash
# Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
# Common fixes:
vercel logs --follow
```

## 🔄 **Future Deployments**

After initial setup, deploying updates is super easy:
```bash
# Just push to GitHub, Vercel auto-deploys!
git add .
git commit -m "Epic new feature ⚔️"
git push origin main

# Or manual deploy:
vercel --prod
```

## 🌐 **Custom Domain (Optional)**

To add a custom domain like `epicdndforge.com`:
1. Buy domain from any registrar
2. In Vercel dashboard → Domains → Add domain  
3. Update DNS records as instructed
