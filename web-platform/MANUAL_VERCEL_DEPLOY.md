# 🚀 Manual Vercel Deployment - Step by Step

Since the CLI interactive prompts are blocking automation, here's the manual approach:

## Step 1: Login to Vercel (Do this now)

**Run this command and follow the prompts:**

```bash
vercel login
```

**Then:**
1. **Use arrow keys** to select "**Continue with GitHub**" 
2. **Press Enter**
3. Your **browser will open** - authorize Vercel to access your GitHub
4. Return to terminal - you should see "✅ Success!"

## Step 2: Verify Login

```bash
vercel whoami
```
You should see your username displayed.

## Step 3: Deploy Your Epic App

```bash
vercel --prod
```

**Follow these prompts:**
```bash
? Set up and deploy "dnd-character-sheets-saas"? → Type: y
? Which scope? → Select your account (press Enter)
? Link to existing project? → Type: n  
? What's your project's name? → Press Enter (keeps default)
? In which directory is your code located? → Press Enter (keeps ./)
```

**Vercel will auto-detect Next.js:**
```bash
Auto-detected Project Settings (Next.js):
- Build Command: npm run build
- Output Directory: .next  
- Install Command: npm install
- Development Command: npm run dev
? Want to modify these settings? → Type: n
```

## Step 4: Get Your Live URL

After deployment completes, you'll see:
```bash
✅ Production: https://dnd-character-sheets-saas-[unique].vercel.app
```

**Copy this URL - your app is now LIVE!** 🎉

## Step 5: Add Environment Variables (Important!)

1. **Go to:** https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Click your project:** `dnd-character-sheets-saas`
3. **Go to:** Settings → Environment Variables
4. **Add these 3 variables:**

```bash
Name: DATABASE_URL
Value: file:./dev.db
Environment: Production ✓ Preview ✓

Name: NEXTAUTH_SECRET  
Value: [generate random 32+ char string like: abc123xyz789...]
Environment: Production ✓ Preview ✓

Name: NEXTAUTH_URL
Value: [your app URL from step 4]
Environment: Production ✓ Preview ✓
```

## Step 6: Redeploy (Auto-happens)

Vercel will automatically redeploy when you add environment variables.

## 🎉 SUCCESS!

Your **Epic D&D Character Forge** is now live and fully functional!

## 🎯 Alternative: One-Command Deploy

If you want to try the CLI approach again after login:

```bash
# After successful login, run:
vercel --prod --yes --force

# This will deploy without prompts
```
